      <h2>Measuring Tips</h2>
      <p>
        Before purchasing furniture, it's essential to measure your space
        carefully to ensure it fits perfectly. Use a tape measure to record the
        following dimensions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Width</li>
        <li>Height</li>
        <li>Depth</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Choosing the Right Size</h2>
      <p>
        When choosing furniture, consider not only the dimensions but also how
        it fits your lifestyle and complements your existing decor.
